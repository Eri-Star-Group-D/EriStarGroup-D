            All the nine ethnic groups possess different musical instruments, beats and rhythms. 
            Through history, music in Eritrea, like many other parts of the world, was confined in regional premises. 
            With the advent of media technology however, the sound of the beats and the ingenuity of folkloric music
             Eritrea possesses started spreading its rhythm to the rest of the country and the region. 
            Although there is no specific time as to when and how music became a part of the Eritrean cultures, 
            it is however definite that the history of music goes as far as centuries when it comes to folkloric 
            music and original cultural rhythms that represent the true identity of the Eritrean cultures.
            
            The one thing which was common between the music from the ages and those sang during the 20th 
            century is that most of the artistic works of music played in Eritrea narrate stories of tribal 
            heroes as well as religious and cultural holidays. The background of music in Eritrea lies deep and 
            goes as far as centuries, but the organized and composed blast of Eritreaâ€™s real musical talent was 
            yet to be unfolded in the late fifties and sixties.

          Eritrean literature in the Tigrinya language dates, as far as is known, from the late 19th century 
          but Ge'ez writings have been found in the 4th century BC. It was initially encouraged by European 
          missionaries, but suffered from the general repression of Eritrean culture under Fascist rule in 
          the 1920s and 30s. The earliest published works were primarily translations or collections of
           traditional poems, fables and folktales, but the renaissance of Eritrean culture promoted by 
          the British administrators after 1942 included the appearance of the first novels in Tigrinya.s.
